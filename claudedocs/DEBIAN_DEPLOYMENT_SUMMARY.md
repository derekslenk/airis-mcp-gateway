# Debian Deployment - Summary

**Question**: How hard would it be to make this stack work on Debian?

**Answer**: ✅ **Very Feasible** - 2-4 hours total effort, mostly straightforward

## Key Finding

Your use case is **ideal** for Debian deployment:
- ✅ Single user, multiple machines → perfect for centralized gateway
- ✅ Trusted LAN → no complex auth needed
- ✅ Comfortable with remote editing → cleanest architecture
- ✅ Code on Debian is fine → optimal for MCP server access

## Effort Assessment

### Complexity: 🟢 Low to Medium

```
Linux (Debian):           🟢 EASY (2-4 hours)
  - Docker native support (better than macOS!)
  - Better performance than Docker Desktop
  - Straightforward path configuration
  - No major architectural changes needed
```

### What Needs to Change

**Critical** (must change):
1. Path updates: `/Users/kazuki/github` → `/home/USER/projects` (5 locations)
2. Client mcp.json: `localhost:9090` → `192.168.15.123:9090`
3. Environment variables: Create `.env` with Debian paths

**Optional** (recommended):
1. Auto-start systemd service
2. Firewall configuration (if enabled)
3. VSCode Remote SSH setup

## Migration Breakdown

### Time Investment

| Task | Automated | Manual | Time |
|------|-----------|--------|------|
| Docker setup | ❌ | ✅ | 15-30 min |
| Config updates | ✅ Script | ✅ Manual | 5-15 min |
| Build & deploy | ✅ Script | ✅ Manual | 10-20 min |
| Client setup | ❌ | ✅ | 5 min/machine |
| Testing | ❌ | ✅ | 30-60 min |
| **Total** | | | **1-2.5 hours** |

**Additional setup (optional)**:
- VSCode Remote SSH: 10-15 min
- Auto-start service: 10 min
- Backups: 20-30 min
- **Extended Total**: 2-4 hours

### Automated vs Manual

**Automated (recommended)**:
```bash
# On Debian - one command
./scripts/setup-debian.sh
```
Handles: paths, config updates, builds, starts services

**Manual**:
Follow: `claudedocs/QUICK_START_DEBIAN.md` (10 steps)

## What You Get

### Before (macOS Current State)
```
Laptop (macOS + OrbStack)
  ↓
Local Gateway (localhost:9090)
  ↓
MCP Servers (local Docker)
```

### After (Debian Deployment)
```
Laptop ────┐
           │
Desktop ───┼──→ Debian Gateway (192.168.15.123:9090)
           │       ↓
Tablet ────┘    MCP Servers (centralized)
                    ↓
                Code (single source of truth)
```

## Advantages of Debian Deployment

### For You

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Code lives on Debian, no sync issues
2. **Centralized Resources**: Shared memory, API keys in one place
3. **Multi-Device**: Same setup works from laptop/desktop/tablet
4. **Always On**: Gateway runs 24/7, no need to start on each machine
5. **Better Performance**: Linux native Docker (faster than macOS)

### Technical

1. **Zero Host Pollution**: Remains containerized
2. **Network Accessible**: LAN-wide availability
3. **Resource Efficiency**: One gateway instance for all clients
4. **Easier Backups**: Central location for volumes and data
5. **Production-Ready**: Can expose via VPN/Tailscale later if needed

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Network issues | Low | Medium | Use LAN, fallback to SSH tunnel |
| Docker permissions | Medium | Low | Script handles usermod -aG docker |
| Path mismatches | Medium | Medium | Automated script updates paths |
| Volume mount fails | Low | High | Script validates before build |
| Port conflicts | Low | Low | Use standard ports, configurable via .env |
| Service won't start | Medium | Medium | Detailed logs + troubleshooting guide |

**Overall Risk**: 🟢 **Low** - Well-documented, recoverable, reversible

## Prerequisites Met

✅ Docker native on Debian (better than macOS)
✅ Network access (LAN 192.168.15.0/24)
✅ SSH access
✅ User control (can install, configure)
✅ Comfortable with remote editing
✅ Code can live on Debian

**Blockers**: None identified

## Decision Framework

### Go Forward If:
- ✅ You want centralized gateway (recommended)
- ✅ You're okay with remote editing (works seamlessly)
- ✅ You have 2-4 hours for migration
- ✅ You want multi-device support

### Hold Off If:
- ❌ You need code strictly local on laptop
- ❌ Network is unstable
- ❌ You can't install Docker on Debian
- ❌ Time constrained (need immediate solution)

**Recommendation**: ✅ **Go Forward** - Your use case is ideal

## Implementation Path

### Option A: Automated (Recommended)
```bash
# On Debian
git clone <repo> ~/projects/airis-mcp-gateway
cd ~/projects/airis-mcp-gateway
./scripts/setup-debian.sh

# On clients
# Update mcp.json to point to 192.168.15.123:9090
```
**Time**: ~30 minutes

### Option B: Manual
```bash
# Follow QUICK_START_DEBIAN.md step-by-step
```
**Time**: ~1-2 hours

### Option C: Gradual Migration
```bash
# Week 1: Set up Debian gateway, test from one client
# Week 2: Migrate second client, verify
# Week 3: Full migration, decommission local setup
```
**Time**: Spread over 2-3 weeks

## Success Metrics

**You'll know it's working when**:

1. ✅ `curl http://192.168.15.123:9090/` returns response
2. ✅ Client mcp.json connects to gateway
3. ✅ Claude Code can list files via filesystem MCP
4. ✅ All MCP servers accessible from all clients
5. ✅ Can edit code remotely (VSCode Remote SSH)
6. ✅ No errors in `docker compose logs`

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Do This First)
1. Read: `QUICK_START_DEBIAN.md`
2. On Debian: Run `./scripts/setup-debian.sh`
3. On client: Update `mcp.json`
4. Test: `curl http://192.168.15.123:9090/`

### Short Term (First Week)
1. Set up VSCode Remote SSH
2. Clone projects to Debian
3. Test all MCP servers
4. Configure auto-start

### Long Term (Optional)
1. Set up automated backups
2. Monitor resource usage
3. Add API integrations (Tavily, etc.)
4. Consider VPN for remote access
